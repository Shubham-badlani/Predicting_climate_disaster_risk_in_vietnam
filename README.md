AICTE Internship 25Aug-25Sept
Week 1 _ 25 Aug to 31 Aug 2025

Project Title :: Predicting Climate-Related Disaster Risk in Vietnam Using Historical Rainfall and Temperature Data 

Description :: This project focuses on analyzing historical climate data from Vietnam (1901–2020), including rainfall and temperature records, to assess and predict climate-related disaster risk. Develop machine learning models to forecast extreme rainfall and temperature events. Generate time-series charts, heatmaps, and geographic risk maps to communicate trends and risk zones. Forecast future disaster risk using historical patterns.
